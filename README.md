# C - Binary Trees

This collaborative project delves into the intricacies, advantages, and drawbacks of utilizing trees as data structures. We explore the qualification of trees and methods to traverse them, implementing binary, binary search, AVL, and Max Binary Heap trees.

## Tests :heavy_check_mark:

* [tests](./tests): Directory housing test files for all tasks, provided by ALX.

## Helper File :raised_hands:

* [binary_tree_print.c](./binary_tree_print.c): A C function for printing binary trees in an aesthetically pleasing format.

## Header File :file_folder:

* [binary_trees.h](./binary_trees.h): Header file encompassing definitions and prototypes for all types and functions developed within the project.

Data Structures
```c
struct binary_tree_s
{
    int n;
    struct binary_tree_s *parent;
    struct binary_tree_s *left;
    struct binary_tree_s *right;
};

typedef struct binary_tree_s binary_tree_t;
typedef struct binary_tree_s bst_t;
typedef struct binary_tree_s avl_t;
typedef struct binary_tree_s heap_t;

## Tasks :page_with_curl:

* **0. New node**
  * [0-binary_tree_node.c](./0-binary_tree_node.c): A C function creating a binary tree node with a given parent and value.
  * Returns a pointer to the new node, or `NULL` on failure.

* **1. Insert left**
  * [1-binary_tree_insert](./1-binary_tree_insert): A C function inserting a node as the left-child of another.
  * Returns a pointer to the new node, or `NULL` on failure.
  * If the given `parent` already contains a left node, the new node takes its place, and the old left-child becomes the left-child of the new node.

* **2. Insert right**
  * [2-binary_tree_insert_right.c](./2-binary_tree_insert_right.c): A C function inserting a node as the right-child of another.
  * Returns a pointer to the new node, or `NULL` on failure.
  * If the given `parent` already contains a right node, the new node takes its place, and the old right-child becomes the right-child of the new node.

* **3. Delete**
  * [3-binary_tree_delete.c](./3-binary_tree_delete.c): A C function deleting an entire binary tree.

* **4. Is leaf**
  * [4-binary_tree_is_leaf.c](./4-binary_tree_is_leaf.c): A C function checking if a given node is a leaf.
  * Returns `1` if the node is a leaf, `0` otherwise.

* **5. Is root**
  * [5-binary_tree_is_root.c](./5-binary_tree
